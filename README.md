# Codsoft Internship - Task Completion

## Overview

This README provides essential information to help users understand and run the projects you've worked on during the internship. All tasks and projects are coded in Python and require certain dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **VSCode**: The code editor used for developing and running the projects. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Installation

To ensure that the projects run smoothly, install the required Python library by following these steps:

1. Open the terminal in VSCode.

2. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install ttkthemes
    ```
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

    This installs the necessary `ttkthemes` & `requests` library.

## Running the Projects

Once the prerequisite and library are installed, follow these steps to run the projects:

1. Open the project in VSCode.

2. Navigate to the terminal in VSCode.

3. Run the code by executing the appropriate command.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the actual filename of the project you want to run.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Project 1: [TO-DO LIST]**
- A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage
and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing
users to create, update, and track their to-do lists

2. **Project 2: [CALCULATOR]**
- Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.

3. **Project 3: [PASSWORD GENERATOR]**
- A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and
random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
password generator application using Python, allowing users to
specify the length and complexity of the password.
  - User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the
password.
  - Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to
generate a password of the specified length.
  - Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

4. **Project 4: [WEATHER FORECAST]**
- Developing a weather forecast application using Python. This project will
involve retrieving weather data from an API and presenting it in a user-friendly
format. The application will provide current weather information, including
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather
conditions.
  - User Input: Prompt the user to enter the name of a city or a zip code.
  - API Request: Make an API request to retrieve weather data based on the user's
input.
  - Parse and Extract: Extract relevant weather information such as temperature,
humidity, and description from the API response.
  - Display Weather: Present the retrieved weather information to the user in a
user-friendly format

5. **Project 5: [QUIZ GAME]**
- Develop a quiz game that asks users multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions on a specific topic. The game
should keep track of scores, provide feedback on correct/incorrect answers, and offer a variety of questions to make
it challenging and engaging.
    - Load Quiz Questions.
    Display Welcome Message and Rules.
    - Present Quiz Questions:
    Display each question and answer choice.
    Prompt the user to select an answer.
    - Evaluate the User's Answer:
    Compare the user's answer with the correct answer.
    Keep track of the user's score.
   - Provide Feedback:
    Display if the answer was correct or incorrect.
    Show the correct answer for incorrect responses.
    Calculate the Final Score.
    - Display Final Results:
    Print the user's score and performance message.
    - Play Again:
    Ask the user if they want to play again.
